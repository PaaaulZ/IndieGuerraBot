# IndieGuerraBot
## A simple script like ItaliaGuerraBot but with indie songs.


### Description

The goal for this project was to make italian indie artists "fight" for a province. City names found in italian indie songs lyrics get placed on a map, the song with most playcount on Spotify wins and gets the province.

**This project is almost 100% tied to [IndieMap](https://github.com/PaaaulZ/IndieMap)**

### NOTE:

I'm not actively working on this project anymore. Spotify does not have a public API that allows us to get playcount for a song and the unofficial API that I used stopped working.
I'm currently trying to make my own private API. I'm trying with memory reading, screen reading softwares and other Spotify "forks" in Python.

I'll start working on this when I find a good API.
